# Ansible + Terraform = Perfect Pairing

## About This Repository

This is a code and presentation bundle that will be used to show how Ansible and Terraform can be used together with AWS for a simple, and complete lifecycle for an application.

The presentation folder contains a PDF of what was presented at the Toronto Ansible Meetup on March 31, 2020 by Eric Wright thanks to the invitation by the team at Arctiq, who host the meetup.
